# Home Automation
### - Create a modular system for turn **"Dumb"** switches and buttons on & Off.
### - This will use relay's & servo's among other things.
### - It needs to interface with my Virtual Assistant system [Link Here](https://github.com/TechyYodaCoder/Virtual_Assistant_Modular)
### - Needs to be able to interface with;
- Plug switches (UK)
- light switches (UK)
- other buttons (such as a Button on a real Echo Dot, so that your virtual assistant can trigger another one.)
- Doorlocks (a bit like my project: [here](https://github.com/TechyYodaCoder/Doorlock)) or [here](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1596180)


### - The Pi will be the **"Brain"**
### - Needs to have physical buttons (Play/Pause, Volume Up, Volume Down, Mute,){Switches: Mute, Listen}{Petentiomiter: Volume}
### - 3D printed Case for switches etc. {this should have power in for the Pi & the servo controller, relay module etc.} - Possibly a LCD screen as well??


## How to interface with Virtual Assistant?;
- Could have it running on only one device (the PI) like [this](https://github.com/TechyYodaCoder/Virtual_Assistant_Computer_Only) version of the VA.


## Things I need;
- Buttons/ Switches / petentiometers, - for the physical inputs(mute, volume, listen etc)
- LCD?, - to display some info
- Microphone, - to take voice commands
- Speaker, - to speak back to you & play music
- Pi, - as the brain
- Servos, - to contrl various aspects
- Servo control Board, to control the servos
- Relays, - to control various aspects
- App, - (to go with it so that we can remote control functions) / Website (To control functions on.)


[Here is my TODO list - this includes the things I have finished and am currently working on.](TODO)
