# Home Automation
##- Create a modular system for turn **"Dumb"** switches and buttons on & Off.
##- This will use relay's & servo's among other things.
##- It needs to interface with my Virtual Assistant system [Link Here](https://github.com/TechyYodaCoder/Virtual_Assistant_Modular)
##- Needs to be able to press;
- Plug switches (UK)
- light switches (UK)
- other buttons (such as a Button on a real Echo Dot, so thatyour virtual assistant can trigger another one.)


## - The Pi will be the **"Brain"**
## - Needs to have physical buttons (Play/Pause, Volume Up, Volume Down, Mute,){Switches: Mute,Listen}{Petentiomiter: Volume}
## - 3D printed Case for switches etc. {this should have power in for the Pi & the servo controller, relay module etc.}


How to interface with Virtual Assistant?;
- Could have it running on only one device (the PI) like [this](https://github.com/TechyYodaCoder/Virtual_Assistant_Computer_Only) version of the VA.


### Things I need;
- Buttons/ Switches,
- Microphone,
- Speaker,
- Pi,
- Servos,
- Servo control Board,
- Relays,
- App (to go with it so that we can remote control functions) / Website (To control functions on.),
