## Still TODO:

## Other:
- create a command to "pair" two servos (as one isn't enought to press a light switch.)
- make callable functions for relay module


### 3D Modelling / Printing:
- 3D model & Print a box for the Pi to go in (with room for switches, petentiometer to go in the lid.)
- 3D model & Print a Light switch mount for two servos.


### Virtual Assistant:
- need to add the help command
- Add more commands
- need to add more recipients in the email section (google Contacts API?)
- need to change it so that it is a GPIO input so that we can run it headlessley on a pi.
- spotify connectivity (https://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-spotify/) - I may do this instead of asking it to play songs
- make the Virtual Assistant start on boot


## Done Things:
~~ - created callable functions for the servos (still need to check the angle for switches)  ~~

~~ - created callable functions for the servo control board ~~

~~ - make two requirments.txt (one for Pi mode, one for Laptop mode) ~~
