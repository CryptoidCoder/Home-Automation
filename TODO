## Done Things:
~~ - created callable functions for the servos (still need to check the angle for switches)  ~~

~~ - created callable functions for the servo control board ~~

~~ - make two requirments.txt (one for Pi mode, one for Laptop mode) ~~

## Still TODO:
- create the Virtual Assistant
- Add more commands:
- - spotify connectivity

- make the Virtual Assistant start on boot


- make callable functions for relay module

- 3D model & Print a box for the Pi to go in (with room for switches, petentiometer to go in the lid.)

Virtual Assistant:
- need to add the help command
- need to add more recipients in the email section (google Contacts API?)
- need to change it so that it is a GPIO input so that we can run it headlessley on a pi.
