# Home-Automation
A project involving servos, relays and other things to turn my home smart.

[Here is the Plan of Production/ Brainstorming.](Plan-Of-Production.md)

[Here is the TODO.](TODO)


## To setup:
create a ```.env``` file with the format as follows:

These can be whatever you want: 

Master = The name it will call you,
TriggerName = what you will call it.
setup_type = what mode it should boot into ('pi' or '1' means it will boot into Raspbery Pi mode), OR ('laptop' or '2' means it will boot into Laptop Mode)
```
Master = "***"
TriggerName = "***"
setup_type = 'pi/ laptop' # pick one

```
